Matrix Command Line Interface

![mtxcli](docs/mtxcli-640x120.png)

## Status

This is very much early development: the client does NOT work yet.

Soon, however, we hope to have basic networking functionality working
such that you can exchage messages with the Matrix network. And then, soon,
be able to create an account and do the "emoji verification dance"
with other users for the full experience.

## Usage

_Documentation coming soon..._
