# mtxcli

Matrix Command Line Interface

![mtxcli](docs/mtxcli-640x120.png)

## Status

This is a revised version of the mtxcli Matrix chat program.
This version, 0.5.0 (and beyond), strives to be as simple as possible
in order to prepare for running on the Xous operating system on
the Betrusted (Precursor) hardware device.

The previous work used the **tokio** library for asynchronous
communication, but became very complex (_NOTE:_ that code
is still available in the `mtxcli-tokio` branch).

This version will display any recent messages after you
type a message to a given room. In this way the code flow
is much easier to develop and debug for the Betrusted environment.

## Prerequsites

Before using this program you should:

1. Setup a new user (if needed) using the Matrix protocol
  * https://matrix.org/docs/projects/try-matrix-now/
2. Create a new room (if needed)
  * https://doc.matrix.tu-dresden.de/en/rooms/create/
3. Join the room

## Usage

When you start using mtxcli you will need to set your user identifer,
your password and the room you would like to join.

You can do this with commands that start with slash `/` (see the example below).
_NOTE_: Type `/help` for a list of available commands.

Perhaps the easist way to explain using mtxcli is by example:
(here I just typed **Hello!** to send a message to the room)
